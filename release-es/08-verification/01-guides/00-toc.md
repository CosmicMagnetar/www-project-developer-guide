### 6.1 Verification guides

[Verification][sammv] is one of the business functions described by the [OWASP SAMM][samm].
The verification activities are wide ranging, and will include:

* Testing of security controls
* Review of controls and security mechanisms
* Evaluation and assessment of the security architecture
* and others

Given the breadth of techniques and knowledge required, guides are an important resource for verification activities.

Sections:

6.1.1 [Web Security Testing Guide](#web-security-testing-guide)  
6.1.2 [MAS Testing Guide](#mas-testing-guide)  
6.1.3 [Application Security Verification Standard](#application-security-verification-standard)
